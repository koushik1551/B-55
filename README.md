Creating Realistic Novel Images through Generative Neural Networks(GAN)
"Novel images" in this project context refer to creative outputs generated by a neural network, unseen in the training dataset, closely mimicking the characteristics and patterns of existing images.
The "Generative Neural Networks for Novel Image Generation" project aims to extend neural networks beyond traditional applications, focusing on generative models. The goal is to train these models to create entirely new visual content resembling a predefined set of training images.
Unlike traditional neural network applications for decision-making tasks, this project represents a shift towards creativity. It involves the synthesis of visual content rather than making determinations based on existing data.
The core objective is to train neural networks to generate images with novelty and diversity
By expanding the applications of neural networks, this project contributes to artistic expression, creative design, and data augmentation, showcasing the model's ingenuity in capturing  details.
The novel images crafted through this project serve as a testament to the model's creativity, highlighting its capacity to generate unique outputs that capture the essence of the training data.
